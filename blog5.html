                    When we talk about the electric vehicle revolution in India, the image that comes to mind for many might be a sleek electric car. But the true engine of this nationwide transformation isn't on four wheels—it's on two and three. India's electric scooters, motorcycles, and rickshaws are not just participating in the e-mobility shift; they are actively leading it. Here's why these vehicle segments are the undisputed key to India's green future.
                </p>
                
                <h2>The Right Vehicle for the Indian Context</h2>
                <p>
                    India's urban landscape is unique. Our cities are dense, our roads are congested, and our need for last-mile connectivity is immense. Two- and three-wheelers are perfectly suited for this environment. They are nimble, require less space for parking, and are ideal for the short-to-medium distance travel that characterizes most urban journeys.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This existing dominance in the petrol era gives them a natural advantage in the electric age. It's far easier for a consumer to switch from a petrol scooter to an electric scooter than to leap from a scooter to a car. This one-to-one replacement model is fueling rapid, large-scale adoption that simply isn't possible in the four-wheeler segment yet.
                </p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 text-center">Why Two & Three-Wheelers Are Leading the Charge</h3>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600 mb-8 text-center">The dominance of this segment is driven by a powerful combination of factors.</p>
                    <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
                        <!-- Card 1: Lower Upfront Cost -->
                        <div class="info-card text-center p-6 bg-green-50 rounded-lg">

                            <h4 class="font-bold text-lg">Affordability</h4>
                            <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-1">The purchase price of an electric 2-wheeler is significantly lower than an electric car, making it accessible to a much wider population.</p>

                        <!-- Card 2: Lower Running Costs -->

                            <h4 class="font-bold text-lg">Lower Running Costs</h4>
                            <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-1">With smaller batteries and higher efficiency, the per-kilometer cost is extremely low, providing immediate savings.</p>

                        <!-- Card 3: Livelihood Engine -->

                            <h4 class="font-bold text-lg">Livelihood Engine</h4>
                            <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-1">For millions of gig workers and auto drivers, these vehicles are not a luxury but an essential tool for earning a living.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>The Power of the Livelihood Connection</h2>
                <p>
                    Perhaps the most critical factor is the direct link between these vehicles and employment. For millions of delivery partners, auto drivers, and small business owners, their vehicle is their office. The economic benefits of switching to electric—saving thousands of rupees per month on fuel—are not just a convenience; they are a direct increase in household income.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This powerful economic incentive creates a level of motivation that is unmatched in the private car market. When your daily earnings depend on it, the decision to switch to a more profitable and efficient vehicle becomes a business necessity, not a lifestyle choice.
                </p>
